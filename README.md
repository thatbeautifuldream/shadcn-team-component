# Next.js Supabase Shadcn Team Component

This project is a codebase for a team component that can be used in a Next.js project. It uses Supabase as the backend to store the team data. I've coded along with the tutorial from [Code with Guillaume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHWIbTEqNs&t=318s) and added some extra features.
